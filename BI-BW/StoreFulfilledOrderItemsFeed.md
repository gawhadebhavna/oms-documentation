### Requirement

Streamline the process of transferring fulfilled order items from HotWax to BI/BW by introducing an automated system for generating the Store Fulfilled Order Items Feed. 
This feed should only contain the order items that are fulfilled from stores instead of warehouses.

### Implementation Flow

1. Moqui:
   1. A scheduled service job will automatically fetch eligible records and prepare the JSON file format of Fulfilled Order Items Feed.
   2. This initial feed will include all order items, weather the order items fulfilled from stores or warehouses.
   3. The prepared file of Fulfilled Order Items feed will be kept on the SFTP location.
   
2. NiFi:
   1. NiFi will read the Fulfilled Order Items Feed file generated by Moqui from the SFTP location, will apply the required transformations 
      and exclude those order items that are fulfilled from warehouses. 
   2. In the further process NiFi will convert the data from JSON format to CSV format and keep the file on the SFTP location for BI/BW consumption.


### NiFi Flow
1. The below processors are used to prepare the NiFi flow:
    1. **ListSFTP**
        1. The ListSFTP processor is used to read and process the HC generated Fulfilled Order Items Feed file from the SFTP location.

    2. **FetchSFTP**
        2. The FetchSFTP processor is used to move the HC generated Fulfilled Order Items Feed file into the archive folder.

    3. **JoltTransformJSON**
        1. The JoltTransformJSON processor is used to transform the HC generated Fulfilled Order Items feed JSON into the
           required JSON format of Store Fulfilled Order Items Feed.

    4. **ConvertRecord**
        1. The ConvertRecord processor is used to convert the Store Fulfilled Order Items Feed file format into the CSV file format.

    5. **UpdateAttribute**
        1. The UpdateAttribute processor is used to update the file name of Store Fulfilled Order Items Feed CSV file format.

    6. **PutSFTP**
        1. The PutSFTP processor is used to put the Store Fulfilled Order Items Feed CSV file at the SFTP.
